# Introduction
The Weather API Project - Clothing Suggestion App is a simple and user-friendly application that fetches weather data from an external API and provides appropriate clothing recommendations for the current weather. It utilizes React, including React Hooks, to build a responsive and interactive user interface.

# Features
Display the current temperature and weather information.
Show dynamic images representing the time of the day (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Suggest appropriate clothing based on the current weather conditions.
Allow users to add new clothes with associated weather types.
Demo
[Include a link to a live demo or provide instructions to access the app]

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository_url>.
Navigate to the project directory: cd weather-api-project.
Install the required dependencies with npm install.

Usage
To start the development server, run: npm start.
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Enter your location or allow the app to access your location for weather data.
The weather card will display the current temperature and suggest appropriate clothing based on the weather conditions.
The background image on the weather card will dynamically change according to the time of the day.
Adding New Clothes
To add new clothes to the app along with their associated weather types, follow these steps:

Click on the "Add Clothes" button on the weather card.
Fill in the details for the new clothing item, including its name and the weather type it is suitable for (e.g., sunny, rainy, cold).
Click on the "Save" button to add the new clothing item to the app's database.
Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Hooks: Used to add state and other React features to functional components.
External Weather API: Fetches weather data from an external API to display weather information.
CSS: For styling the user interface.

Contributions to the Weather API Project - Clothing Suggestion App are always welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
